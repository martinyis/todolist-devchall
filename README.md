## Reflection

The project was created for the purpose of training and practice.
The main goal was to allow the user to add his tasks to the to-do list and the ability to edit them and mark them for deletion.

The main problem was to add tasks to all three containers simultaneously and so that they were synchronized with each other. I came up with a way which is not very optimal, but it works. The way was to add to the newly generated job class with random name consisting of random numbers. Thus, the task that the user adds to the page was uniquely marked

Fro this project I used publci design from Figma and structure language such a HTML. For styles I used Sass compiler and for functional side of a project I used JS
